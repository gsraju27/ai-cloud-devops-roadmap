## Salary Negotiation Tips

### Service-Based
- Usually fixed packages, limited negotiation
- Focus on getting into higher band (Digital, Specialist roles)
- Ask about variable pay, joining bonus

### Product-Based
- Always negotiate! Initial offer is rarely the best
- Research on Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Grapevine
- Get competing offers if possible
- Negotiate base salary, stocks, joining bonus separately

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Applying to only one type of company** - Apply to both, see what works
2. **Ignoring aptitude for product-based prep** - Many startups have aptitude rounds
3. **Not practicing on paper** - Service-based companies often ask you to code on paper
4. **Memorizing answers** - Understand concepts, interviewers can tell
5. **Poor communication** - Practice explaining your thought process
6. **Ignoring HR round** - Many rejections happen in HR round
7. **Last-minute preparation** - Start early, consistency beats cramming

Focus on learning, stay consistent, and trust the process. Good luck!
